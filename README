Javaclient2 for Player/Stage 2.x
---------------------------------
Javaclient2 has been redeveloped to work with the new Player/Stage 2.x API. 
The client is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the 
mention that portions of it (the javaclient2.xdr.* package) has been borrowed 
from the Remote Tea package, released under LGPL by Harald Albrecht.
The Javaclient homepage is:

  http://java-player.sourceforge.net


Installation
------------
Download and install Player and/or Stage/Gazebo from 
http://playerstage.sourceforge.net, then compile the sources from the 
Javaclient2 package either using ANT or manually. Note that Javaclient2 has 
been developed and tested using Sun's JDK 1.5. 

In case you run into any troubles, don't hesitate to send a message with 
a description of the problem to our mailing list at 
java-player-users@lists.sf.net.
