	* PULL mode + AddReplaceRule finally works fine. Example on how to use
	it:
	<PlayerClient>.requestDataDeliveryMode 
	    (PlayerConstants.PLAYER_DATAMODE_PULL);
	<PlayerClient>.readAll ();
	<PlayerClient>.requestAddReplaceRule 
	    (-1, -1, PlayerConstants.PLAYER_MSGTYPE_DATA, -1, 1);
	<PlayerClient>.readAll (); 
	
	* Changed Position1dInterface to match Brian's refactorization.
	
	* All reads are blocking now (read -> readFully) so at least the 
	client gets THE data (get/setTimeout disabled for now).

	* Several bugs fixed, including <Position>.setSpeed 
	(thanks to Hugo Marques), <Sonar>.read (the last value of the
	sonar values array wasn't being read), and <PlayerClient>.readAll 
	(sometimes in.available () doesn't return anything - delay between 
	Player sending data and the client receiving it => get/setTimeout)
